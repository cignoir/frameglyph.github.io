# Installation

## Install from Steam

1. Purchase Frameglyph on [Steam](#).
2. The application will be installed automatically.

## FFmpeg Setup

FFmpeg is required for video export features. Frameglyph does not bundle FFmpeg — you need to install it separately.

1. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Extract to a directory (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).
3. In Frameglyph, go to **Preferences > System > FFmpeg Configuration**.
4. Set the path to `ffmpeg.exe` (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`).

::: tip
You can also add FFmpeg to your system PATH. Frameglyph will detect it automatically.
