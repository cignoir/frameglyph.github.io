# Timeline

![Timeline with bookmarks](/images/screenshots/timeline.png)

The timeline provides a unified view of your project, allowing you to navigate media, manage bookmarks, select ranges for export, and control track-specific settings.

## Bookmarks

- Press **B** or use the toolbar to add bookmarks at important moments.
- Navigate quickly between bookmarks using **Next Bookmark** and **Previous Bookmark** shortcuts, or by clicking the markers on the timeline ruler.
- Bookmarks are saved with the project file.

## Range Selection

Set In/Out points to define a specific range on the timeline:
- **Set Loop In**: Start of the selected range
- **Set Loop Out**: End of the selected range

The selected range is used for:
- Repeating a section during **Loop Playback**
- Exporting only a specific portion of your session

## Track Management

When multiple videos are loaded, each video occupies a distinct track. Click the gear icon on a track header to access:
- **Track Audio Settings**: Adjust individual track volume or Mute/Unmute.
- **Track Speed Settings**: Set track-specific playback speeds.

## Keyframe Management

Annotations that use keyframes (such as Text and Live Ink) are displayed on the timeline. You can:
- Add keyframes at the current frame
- Move keyframes by dragging them left or right
- Delete keyframes from the timeline
