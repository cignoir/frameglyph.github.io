# Screen Capture

Frameglyph includes a built-in screen recording feature for capturing your screen directly into your review workflow.

## Recording

1. Start a capture using the **Start / Stop Capture** shortcut or the toolbar button.
2. Select the area, application, or specific window to record.
3. Stop the recording when finished.

The captured video is automatically imported into a new slot in Frameglyph.

## Settings

Configure screen capture in **Preferences > Captures**:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Save Location** | Directory where recordings are saved |
| **Frame Rate (FPS)** | Recording FPS (higher produces smoother video but larger files) |
| **Format** | WebM (native), MP4, APNG, or GIF (MP4/APNG/GIF require FFmpeg) |
| **Hide Mouse Cursor** | Exclude the mouse cursor from screen captures |
| **Copy to Clipboard** | Copy the recorded video file to the clipboard after saving |
| **Show Window** | Show the main window after recording finishes (when minimized to tray) |

::: tip
If MP4, APNG, or GIF conversion fails, WebM will be saved as a fallback.
