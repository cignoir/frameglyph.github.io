# Screen Capture

Frameglyph includes a built-in screen recording feature for capturing your screen directly into the review workflow.

## Recording

1. Start a capture using the capture shortcut or the toolbar button.
2. Select the area or window to record.
3. Stop the recording when finished.

The captured video is automatically imported into Frameglyph.

## Settings

Configure screen capture in **Preferences > Captures**:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Save Location** | Directory where recordings are saved |
| **Frame Rate** | Recording FPS (higher = smoother but larger files) |
| **Format** | WebM (native), MP4, or GIF (MP4/GIF require FFmpeg) |
| **Copy to Clipboard** | Automatically copy the file after recording |
| **Show Window** | Show the main window after recording finishes |

::: tip
If MP4 or GIF conversion fails, WebM is saved as a fallback.
