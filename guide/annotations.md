# Annotations

Frameglyph provides a suite of drawing and text tools to annotate directly on your video frames.

## Drawing Tools

The following tools are available in the **Annotate** workspace (accessible via the Layout panel):

### Live Ink (Freehand)
Select **Freehand** to draw organically on the video canvas. Strokes are recorded with timing data and play back in sync with the video. 
- *Tip: If you use a tablet, **Pressure Sensitivity** is supported (enable in **Preferences > Appearance**).*
- *Live Ink Options: You can configure the video to **Auto-play video on Live Ink start** or **Record Motion Strokes** from the Live Ink settings.*

### Shapes
Draw precise shapes: **Rectangle**, **Circle**, **Arrow**, and straight **Lines**. Useful for highlighting specific areas or directing attention.

### Text & Eraser
Use **Text** to place labels anywhere on the frame. Use the **Eraser** tool to remove specific strokes or annotations.

## Working with Annotations

- Annotations are tied to specific frames and time ranges via keyframes.
- Use **Select & Edit** to move, resize, or delete annotations.
- Use **Clear All** to quickly remove everything on the current frame.
- **Undo** and **Redo** are fully supported for all drawing actions.

## Style Editing

Each annotation supports customizable styles from the toolbar:
- **Outline Color** and **Width** for drawings and shapes
- **Font**, **Size**, and **Text Color** for text
- **Toggle Outline** and **Toggle Fill** options
- **Background** color and **Opacity**

## Keyframes

Annotations can be animated across frames using keyframes on the timeline. This allows annotations to appear, move, or disappear at specific points in the video.
