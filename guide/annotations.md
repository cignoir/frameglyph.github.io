# Annotations

![Annotations with Live Ink recording mode](/images/screenshots/annotations.png)

Frameglyph provides drawing and text tools to annotate directly on video frames.

## Drawing Tools

### Live Ink (Freehand)
Draw freely on the video canvas. Strokes are recorded with timing data and can be played back in sync with the video.

### Shapes
Draw rectangles, circles, arrows, and lines. Useful for highlighting specific areas in the frame.

### Text
Add text labels at any position on the frame. Customize font, size, color, outline, and background.

## Working with Annotations

- Annotations are tied to specific frames and time ranges via keyframes.
- Select, move, resize, or delete annotations using the selection tool.
- Use **Select All** and **Delete Selected** for batch operations.

## Style Editing

Each annotation supports customizable styles:
- **Stroke color and width** for drawings and shapes
- **Font, size, text color** for text annotations
- **Outline** with configurable color and width
- **Background** with color and opacity

## Keyframes

Annotations can be animated across frames using keyframes on the timeline. This allows annotations to appear, move, or disappear at specific points in the video.
