## FAQ

### What are the system requirements?
Frameglyph runs on Windows. FFmpeg is required for video export features.

### How do I install FFmpeg?
Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and set the path in Preferences > System > FFmpeg Configuration.

### My export failed. What should I check?
1. Verify FFmpeg is correctly configured in Preferences.
2. Ensure the output directory exists and is writable.
3. Check that the source video file is not corrupted.

### Can I use Frameglyph without FFmpeg?
You can review and annotate videos without FFmpeg, but export features require it.
